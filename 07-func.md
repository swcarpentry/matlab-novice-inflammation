::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If we only had one data set to analyze,
it would probably be faster to load the file into a spreadsheet
and use that to plot some simple statistics.
But we have twelve files to check,
and may have more in future.
In this lesson,
we'll learn how to write a function
so that we can repeat several operations with a single command.

Let's start by defining a function `fahr_to_kelvin` that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin:

```matlab
function ktemp = fahr_to_kelvin(ftemp)
    %FAHR_TO_KELVIN   Convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin

    ktemp = ((ftemp - 32) * (5/9)) + 273.15;
end
```

A MATLAB function *must* be saved in a text file with a `.m` extension.
The name of that file must be the same as the function defined
inside it. The name must start with a letter and cannot contain spaces.
So, you will need to save the above code in a file called
`fahr_to_kelvin.m`.
Remember to save your m-files in the current directory.

The first line of our function is called the *function definition*,
and it declares that we're writing a function named `fahr_to_kelvin`,
that has a single input parameter,`ftemp`,
and a single output parameter, `ktemp`.
Anything following the function definition line is called the *body* of the
function. The keyword `end` marks the end of the function body, and the
function won't know about any code after `end`.

![](fig/function_definition.png){alt='function-definition'}

A function can have multiple input and output parameters if required,
but isn't required to have any of either.
The general form of a function is shown in the pseudo-code below:

```matlab
function [out1, out2] = function_name(in1, in2)
    %FUNCTION_NAME   Function description

    % This section below is called the body of the function
    out1 = something calculated;
    out2 = something else;
end
```

Just as we saw with scripts, functions must be *visible* to MATLAB, i.e.,
a file containing a function has to be placed in a directory that
MATLAB knows  about. The most convenient of those directories is the
current working directory.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## GNU Octave

In common with MATLAB, Octave searches the current working directory and
the path for functions called from the command line.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We can call our function from the command line
like any other MATLAB function:

```matlab
>> fahr_to_kelvin(32)
```

```output
ans = 273.15
```

When we pass a value, like `32`, to the function, the value is assigned
to the variable `ftemp` so that it can be used inside the function. If we
want to return a value from the function, we must assign that value to a
variable named `ktemp`\---in the first line of our function, we promised
that the output of our function would be named `ktemp`.

Outside of the function, the variables `ftemp` and `ktemp` aren't visible;
they are only used by the function body to refer to the input and
output values.

This is one of the major differences between scripts and functions:
a script can be thought of as automating the command line,
with full access to all variables in the base workspace,
whereas a function can only read and write variables from the calling workspace
if they are passed as arguments ---
i.e. a function has its own separate workspace.

Now that we've seen how to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin, it's easy to convert
Kelvin to Celsius.

```matlab
function ctemp = kelvin_to_celsius(ktemp)
    %KELVIN_TO_CELSIUS   Convert from Kelvin to Celcius

    ctemp = ktemp - 273.15;
end
```

Again, we can call this function like any other:

```matlab
>> kelvin_to_celsius(0.0)
```

```output
ans = -273.15
```

What about converting Fahrenheit to Celsius?
We could write out the formula, but we don't need to.
Instead, we can [compose](../learners/reference.md#function-composition) the two
functions we have already created:

```matlab
function ctemp = fahr_to_celsius(ftemp)
    %FAHR_TO_CELSIUS   Convert Fahrenheit to Celcius

    ktemp = fahr_to_kelvin(ftemp);
    ctemp = kelvin_to_celsius(ktemp);
end
```

Calling this function,

```matlab
>> fahr_to_celsius(32.0)
```

we get, as expected:

```output
ans = 0
```

This is our first taste of how larger programs are built:
we define basic operations,
then combine them in ever-larger chunks to get the effect we want.
Real-life functions will usually be larger than the ones shown
here---typically half a dozen to a few dozen lines---but
they shouldn't ever be much longer than that,
or the next person who reads it won't be able to understand what's going on.

## Concatenating in a Function

In MATLAB, we concatenate strings by putting them into an array or using the
`strcat` function:

```matlab
>> disp(['abra', 'cad', 'abra'])
```

```output
abracadabra
```

```matlab
>> disp(strcat('a', 'b'))
```

```output
ab
```

Write a function called `fence` that has two parameters, `original` and
`wrapper` and adds `wrapper` before and after `original`:

```matlab
>> disp(fence('name', '*'))
```

```output
*name*
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```matlab
function wrapped = fence(original, wrapper)
    %FENCE   Return original string, with wrapper prepended and appended

    wrapped = strcat(wrapper, original, wrapper);
end
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Getting the Outside

If the variable `s` refers to a string, then `s(1)` is the string's first
character and `s(end)` is its last. Write a function called `outer` that returns
a string made up of just the first and last characters of its input:

```matlab
>> disp(outer('helium'))
```

```output
hm
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```matlab
function ends = outer(s)
    %OUTER   Return first and last characters from a string

    ends = strcat(s(1), s(end));
end
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Variables Inside and Outside Functions

Consider our function `fahr_to_kelvin` from earlier in the episode:

```matlab
function ktemp = fahr_to_kelvin(ftemp)
  %FAHR_TO_KELVIN   Convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin
  ktemp = ((ftemp-32)*(5.0/9.0)) + 273.15;
end
```

What does the following code display when run --- and why?

```matlab
ftemp = 0
ktemp = 0

disp(fahr_to_kelvin(8))
disp(fahr_to_kelvin(41))
disp(fahr_to_kelvin(32))

disp(ktemp)
```

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```output
259.8167
278.1500
273.1500
0
```

`ktemp` is 0 because the function `fahr_to_kelvin` has no knowledge of
the variable `ktemp` which exists outside of the function.



:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Once we start putting things in functions so that we can
re-use them, we need to start testing that those functions are
working correctly.
To see how to do this, let's write a function to center a
dataset around a particular value:

```matlab
function out = center(data, desired)
    out = (data - mean(data(:))) + desired;
end
```

We could test this on our actual data, but since we
don't know what the values ought to be,
it will be hard to tell if the result was correct,
Instead, let's create a matrix of 0's, and then center that
around 3:

```matlab
>> z = zeros(2,2);
>> center(z, 3)
```

```output
ans =

   3   3
   3   3
```

That looks right, so let's try out `center` function on our real data:

```matlab
>> data = readmatrix('data/inflammation-01.csv');
>> centered = center(data(:), 0)
```

It's hard to tell from the default output whether the
result is correct--this is often the case when working with
fairly large arrays--but, there are a few simple tests that
will reassure us.

Let's calculate some simple statistics:

```matlab
>> disp([min(data(:)), mean(data(:)), max(data(:))])
```

```output
0.00000    6.14875   20.00000
```

And let's do the same after applying our `center` function
to the data:

```matlab
>> disp([min(centered(:)), mean(centered(:)), max(centered(:))])
```

```output
   -6.1487   -0.0000   13.8513
```

That seems almost right: the original mean
was about 6.1, so the lower bound from zero is now about -6.1.
The mean of the centered data isn't quite zero--we'll explore
why not in the challenges--but it's pretty close. We can even
go further and check that the standard
deviation hasn't changed:

```matlab
>> std(data(:)) - std(centered(:))
```

```output
5.3291e-15
```

The difference is very small. It's still possible that our function
is wrong, but it seems unlikely enough that we should probably
get back to doing our analysis. We have one more task first, though:
we should write some [documentation](../learners/reference.md#documentation)
for our function to remind ourselves later what it's for and
how to use it.

```matlab
function out = center(data, desired)
    %CENTER   Center data around a desired value.
    %
    %       center(DATA, DESIRED)
    %
    %   Returns a new array containing the values in
    %   DATA centered around the value.

    out = (data  - mean(data(:))) + desired;
end
```

Comment lines immediately below the function definition line
are called "help text". Typing `help function_name` brings
up the help text for that function:

```matlab
>> help center
```

```output
Center   Center data around a desired value.

    center(DATA, DESIRED)

Returns a new array containing the values in
DATA centered around the value.
```

## Testing a Function

1. Write a function called `normalise` that takes an array as input and returns an
  array of the same shape with its values scaled to lie in the range 0.0 to 1.0.
  (If L and H are the lowest and highest values in the input array, respectively,
  then the function should map a value v to (v - L)/(H - L).) Be sure to give the
  function a comment block explaining its use.

2. Run `help linspace` to see how to use `linspace` to generate
  regularly-spaced values. Use arrays like this to test your `normalise` function.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

1. 
````
```
function out = normalise(in)
    %NORMALISE   Return original array, normalised so that the
    %            new values lie in the range 0 to 1.

    H = max(max(in));
    L = min(min(in));
    out = (in-L)/(H-L);
end
```

2. 
````
```
a = linspace(1, 10);   % Create evenly-spaced vector
norm_a = normalise(a); % Normalise vector
plot(a, norm_a)        % Visually check normalisation
```

## Convert a script into a function

Write a function called `plot_dataset` which plots the three summary graphs
(max, min, std) for a given inflammation data file.

The function should operate on a single data file,
and should have two parameters: `file_name` and `plot_switch`.
When called, the function should create the three graphs produced in the
previous lesson. Whether they are displayed or saved to the `results` directory
should be controlled by the value of `plot_switch`
i.e. `plot_dataset('data/inflammation-01.csv', 0)`
should display the corresponding graphs for the first data set;
`plot_dataset('data/inflammation-02.csv', 1)` should save the figures for the second
dataset to the `results` directory.

You should mostly be reusing code from the `plot_all` script.

Be sure to give your function help text.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```matlab
function plot_dataset(file_name, plot_switch)
    %PLOT_DATASET    Perform analysis for named data file.
    %   Create figures to show average, max and min inflammation.
    %   Display plots in GUI using plot_switch = 0,
    %   or save to disk using plot_switch = 1.
    %
    %   Example:
    %       plot_dataset('data/inflammation-01.csv', 0)
    
    % Generate string for image name:
    img_name = replace(file_name, '.csv', '.png');
    img_name = replace(img_name, 'data', 'results');

    patient_data = readmatrix(file_name);
    
    if plot_switch == 1
    	figure('visible', 'off')
    else
    	figure('visible', 'on')
    end
    
    subplot(2, 2, 1)
    plot(mean(patient_data, 1))
    ylabel('average')
    
    subplot(2, 2, 2)
    plot(max(patient_data, [], 1))
    ylabel('max')
    
    subplot(2, 2, 3)
    plot(min(patient_data, [], 1))
    ylabel('min')
    
    if plot_switch == 1
        print(img_name, '-dpng')
        close()
    end
 end
```

## Automate the analysis for all files

Modify the `plot_all` script so that as it loops over the
data files, it calls the function `plot_dataset` for each file
in turn.
Your script should save the image files to the 'results' directory
rather than displaying the figures in the MATLAB GUI.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```matlab
%PLOT_ALL    Analyse all inflammation datasets
%   Create figures to show average, max and min inflammation.
%   Save figures to 'results' directory.

files = dir('data/inflammation-*.csv');

for i = 1:length(files)
    file_name = files(i).name;
    file_name = fullfile('data', file_name);

    % Process each data set, saving figures to disk.
    plot_dataset(file_name, 1);
end
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

We have now solved our original problem: we can analyze
any number of data files with a single command.
More importantly, we have met two of the most important
ideas in programming:

1. Use arrays to store related values, and loops to
  repeat operations on them.

2. Use functions to make code easier to re-use and
  easier to understand.

- Break programs up into short, single-purpose functions with meaningful names.
- Define functions using the `function` keyword.
