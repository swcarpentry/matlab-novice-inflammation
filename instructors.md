title: Programming with MATLAB
subtitle: Instructor's Guide
---
*   Scientists are using computers to do amazing things, like
    *   predict the physics of aircraft,
    *   develop atomic and molecular models to better understand matter,
    *   simulate the motion of planets, stars and galaxies, and
    *   study the biological processes that form the building blocks of life.
*   But for every successful simulation of global climate, there are a dozen
    more groups struggling just to get their program to run.
    *   Many of them tweak and tinker for months, or years,
        till their code does something more than produce zeros, or grind to a halt.
*   All of this pain can be avoided by
    *   writing programs that are well-documented,
    *   properly reusing code in programs,
    *   automating tasks that are done often, and
    *   systematically finding and fixing bugs when they appear.
*   The good news is that none of this is rocket science.
    *   Like callibrating an oscilloscope or titrating a solution,
        they are skills that are quickly picked up
        and become easier with practice
*   We use MATLAB in our lesson because
    *   we have to use *something* for our lesson,
    *   it's well documented,
    *   it has a large user base among scientists in academia and the industry, and
    *   it has a large library of packages for performing diverse tasks.
*   In today's lesson, we'll learn how to
    *   load, analyze and visualize data in MATLAB,
    *   get our program to *repeat* tasks by writing *loops*,
    *   get our programs to *make decisions* using *conditionals*,
    *   make our code *reusable* by writing *scripts* and *functions*,
    *   write programs that *check themselves* for bugs,
*   Along the way, learn some good programming practices, that will save us
    plenty of time, sweat and tears in the long run.
