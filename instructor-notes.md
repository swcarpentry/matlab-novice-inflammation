# Lesson design

The timings for this lesson are reasonably accurate, but will be updated based on experience.
I usually get part way through the functions episode in about 6 hours.

The lesson is designed to be taught sequentially,
so doesn't lend itself to skipping sections.

# Technical tips and tricks

Make sure the font size is large enough:

```
Preferences > Fonts > Desktop code font
Preferences > Fonts > Desktop text font
```

On Windows, the default font doesn't give a clear distinction between the letter *l* and the number *1*.
Consolas seems to be a reasonable choice in this regard.
