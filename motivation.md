## The Problem

- Scientists are using computers to do amazing things, like
    - predict the physics of aircraft,
    - develop atomic and molecular models to better understand matter,
    - simulate the motion of planets, stars and galaxies, and
    - study the biological processes that form the building blocks of life.

## The Problem

- But for every successful simulation of global climate, there are a dozen
more groups struggling just to get their program to run.

- Many of them tweak and tinker for months, or years,
till their code does something more than produce zeros, or grind to a halt.

## The Solution

- All of this pain can be avoided by
    - writing programs that are well-documented,
    - properly reusing code in programs,
    - automating tasks that are done often, and
    - systematically finding and fixing bugs when they appear.

## The Solution

- The good news is that none of this is rocket science
- Like callibrating an oscilloscope, or titrating a solution, they are
skills that are quickly picked up, and become easier with practice
- ...and they will be the focus of today's lesson.

## Why MATLAB?

- We use MATLAB in our lesson because
    - we have to use *something* for our lesson,
    - it's well documented,
    - it has a large user base among scientists in academia and the industry, and
    - it has a large library of packages for performing diverse tasks.

## Today's Lesson

- In today's lesson, we'll learn how to
    - load, analyze and visualize data in MATLAB,
    - get our program to *repeat* tasks by writing *loops*,
    - get our programs to *make decisions* using *conditionals*,
    - make our code *reusable* by writing *scripts* and *functions*,
    - write programs that *check themselves* for bugs,

## Today's Lesson

- ...and along the way, learn some good programming practices, that will save us
plenty of time, sweat and tears in the long run.
