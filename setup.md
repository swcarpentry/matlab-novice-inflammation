title: Setup
---

You will need to install MATLAB or [GNU Octave][gnu-octave] to do this lesson.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

1. Download [matlab-novice-inflammation.zip](data/matlab-novice-inflammation.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.

2. Extract the zip archive. This will create a `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory containing the data files used in the lesson.
  Note that on Windows, double-clicking on the zip file simply previews the contents: to extract, right-click and select **Extract All**

3. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:
  
  ```bash
  cd Desktop/matlab-novice-inflammation/
  ```
