Recall that we have to do this analysis for every one of our dozen datasets.
And we need a better way than
typing out commands for each one,
because we'll find ourselves writing a lot of duplicate code.
Remember, code that is repeated in two or more places
will eventually be wrong in at least one.
Also, if we  make changes in the way we analyze our datasets,
we have to introduce that change in every copy of our code.
To avoid all of this repetition, we have to teach MATLAB to
repeat our commands,
and to do *that*,
we have to learn how to write *loops*.

Suppose we want to print each character in the word "lead" on
a line of its own. One way is to use four `disp` statements:

~~~
word = 'lead';

disp(word(1));
disp(word(2));
disp(word(3));
disp(word(4));
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
l
e
a
d
~~~
{: .output}

But this is a bad approach for two reasons:

1. It doesn't scale: if we want to print the characters
in a string that's hundreds of letters long, we'd be better
off typing them in.

2. It's fragile: if we change `word` to a longer string,
it only
prints part of the data, and if we change it to
a shorter one,
it produces an error, because we're asking for characters
that don't exist.

~~~
word = 'tin';

disp(word(1));
disp(word(2));
disp(word(3));
disp(word(4));
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
error: A(I): index out of bounds; value 4 out of bound 3
~~~
{: .error}

There's a better approach:

~~~
word = 'lead';

for letter = 1:4
    disp(word(letter))
end
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
l
e
a
d
~~~
{: .output}

This improved version uses a [for loop]({{ site.github.url }}/reference/#for-loop) to
repeat an operation---in this case, printing to the screen---once for
each element in an array.

The general form of a for loop is:

~~~
for variable = collection
    do things with variable
end
~~~
{: .source}

The for loop executes the commands in the
[loop body]({{ site.github.url }}/reference/#loop-body)
for every value in the array `collection`.
This value is called the [loop variable]({{ site.github.url }}/reference/#loop-variable),
and we can call it whatever we like.
In our example, we gave it the name `letter`.

We have to terminate the loop body with the `end` keyword,
and we can have as many commands as we like in the loop body.
But, we have to remember
that they will all be repeated as many times as
there are values in `collection`.

Our for loop has made our code more scalable,
and less fragile.
There's still one little thing about it that should bother us.
For our loop to deal appropriately with shorter or longer words,
we have to change the first line of our loop by hand:

~~~
word = 'tin';

for letter = 1:3
    disp(word(letter));
end
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
t
i
n
~~~
{: .output}

Although this works,
it's not the best way to write our loop:

* We might update `word` and forget to modify the loop to reflect that
  change.

* We might make a mistake while counting the number of letters in
  `word`.

Fortunately,
MATLAB provides us with a convenient function to
write a better loop:

~~~
word = 'aluminum';

for letter = 1:length(word)
    disp(word(letter));
end
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
a
l
u
m
i
n
u
m
~~~
{: .output}

This is much more robust code,
as it can deal identically with
words of arbitrary length.
Here's another loop that
repeatedly updates the variable `len`:

~~~
len = 0
for vowel = 'aeiou'
    len = len + 1;
end

disp(['Number of vowels: ', num2str(len)])
~~~
{: .matlab}

It's worth tracing the execution of this little program step by step.
Since there are five characters in "aeiou",
the loop body will be executed five times.
When we enter the loop, `len` is zero -
the value assigned to it beforehand.
The first time through,
the loop body adds 1 to the old value of `len`,
producing 1,
and updates `len` to refer to that new value.
The next time around,
`vowel` is `e`,
and `len` is 1,
so `len` is updated to 2.
After three more updates,
`len` is 5;
since there's nothing left in `aeiou` for MATLAB to process,
the loop finishes and the `disp` statement tells us our final answer.

Note that a loop variable is just a variable
that's being used to record progress in a loop.
It still exists after the loop is over,
and we can re-use variables previously defined as loop variables as well:

~~~
disp(vowel)
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
u
~~~
{: .output}

We now have almost everything we need to process
multiple data files with our `analyze` script.
You'll notice that our data files are named
`inflammation-01.csv`, `inflammation-02.csv`, etc.
Let's write a loop that tries to print the names of each one of our files:

~~~
for idx = 1:12
    file_name = sprintf('inflammation-%d.csv', idx);
    disp(file_name);
end
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
inflammation-1.csv
inflammation-2.csv
inflammation-3.csv
inflammation-4.csv
inflammation-5.csv
inflammation-6.csv
inflammation-7.csv
inflammation-8.csv
inflammation-9.csv
inflammation-10.csv
inflammation-11.csv
inflammation-12.csv
~~~
{: .output}

This is close, but not quite right.
The `sprintf` function is useful when we want to
generate MATLAB strings based on a _template_.
In our case,
that template is the string `inflammation-%d.csv`.
`sprintf`
generates a new string from our template by
replacing the `%d` with
the data referred to by our second argument, `i`.

Again, let's trace the execution of our loop:
in the beginning of our loop,
`i` starts by referring to the value 1.
So, when MATLAB executes the command

~~~
file_name = sprintf('inflammation-%d.csv', idx);
~~~
{: .matlab}

it substitutes the `%d` in the template `inflammation-%d.csv`,
with the value of `i`, i.e., 1.
The resulting string is `inflammation-1.csv`,
which is assigned to the variable `file_name`.
The `disp` command prints that string to screen.
The second time around, `sprintf` generates the string `inflammation-2.csv`,
which is assigned to the variable `file_name`,
and printed to screen.
And so on, till `i` finally refers to the value 12.

Notice that there's a mistake.
Our files are actually named
`inflammation-01.csv`, `inflammation-02.csv`, etc.
To get it right, we have to modify our template:

~~~
for idx = 1:12
    file_name = sprintf('inflammation-%02d.csv', idx);
    disp(file_name);
end
~~~
{: .matlab}

~~~
inflammation-01.csv
inflammation-02.csv
inflammation-03.csv
inflammation-04.csv
inflammation-05.csv
inflammation-06.csv
inflammation-07.csv
inflammation-08.csv
inflammation-09.csv
inflammation-10.csv
inflammation-11.csv
inflammation-12.csv
~~~
{: .output}

We've replaced `%d` in our earlier template with `%02d`.
With this,
we're specifying that we want our data to be displayed
with a minimum width of 2 characters,
and that we want to _pad_ with 0 for data
that isn't at least 2 digits long.

We're now ready to modify `analyze.m` to process multiple data files:

~~~
% script analyze_loops.m

for idx = 1:3

    % Generate strings for file and image names:
    file_name = sprintf('data/inflammation-%02d.csv', idx);
    img_name = sprintf ('patient_data-%02d.png', idx);

    patient_data = csvread(file_name);

    disp(['Maximum inflammation: ', num2str(max(patient_data(:)))]);
    disp(['Minimum inflammation: ', num2str(min(patient_data(:)))]);
    disp(['Standard deviation: ', num2str(std(patient_data(:)))]);

    ave_inflammation = mean(patient_data, 1);

    figure('visible', 'off')

    subplot(2, 2, 1);
    plot(ave_inflammation);
    ylabel('average')

    subplot(2, 2, 2);
    plot(max(patient_data, [], 1));
    ylabel('max')

    subplot(2, 2, 3);
    plot(min(patient_data, [], 1));
    ylabel('min')

    print('-dpng', img_name);
    close();

end
~~~
{: .matlab}

Save the `analyze.m` script as a new script called `analyze_loops.m`.
To do this, we go to the `Editor` tab, click on the arrow below `Save`,
and then on `Save As...`.
Remember that to run our script,
we simply type in its name in the command line:

~~~
analyze_loops
~~~
{: .matlab}

<img src="../img/02-loop_1.png" style="width:500px; height:400px">

<img src="../img/02-loop_2.png" style="width:500px; height:400px">

<img src="../img/02-loop_3.png" style="width:500px; height:400px">

Sure enough, the maxima of these data sets show exactly
the same ramp as the first,
and their minima show the same staircase structure.

We've now automated the analysis and have confirmed that all the data
files show the same artifact. This is what we set out to test, and now
we can just call one function to do it. With minor modifications, this
function could be re-used to check all our future data files.
